## FAQ

* Q. Why is minecraft so small and part of my screen white?
  * A. You probably have screen scaling on or are using a high DPI screen. There are 4 possible ways to fix this:
    * You can pass the following string in as a java argument in the settings tab
      * `-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=1.0`
    * You can install ClientsideEssentials mod or UniTweaks and use their screen scaling fix from GCAPI config options (fix may produce small artifacts with this option)
    * You can change the DPI settings for Prism Launcher to system
    * Or, you can change your screen scaling to 100%
